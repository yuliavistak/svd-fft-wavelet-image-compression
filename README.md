# svd-fft-wavelet-image-compression
  The project provides three algorithms Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Wavelet Transform, and compares their efficiency on image processing. The main objectives are to reduce the size of the photos from the modern mobile devices and determine which allocates a balance between the quality of the image and its size.
